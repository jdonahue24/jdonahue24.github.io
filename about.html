			<p style="color: black" class="editable"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I am currently a 3rd year at Northeastern University studying Mechanical Engineering and Physics, as well as pursuing a M.S. in Mechatronics. In my career, I strive to help develop the next tool that will push the world further, and continue to build my engineering intuition and technical skills. In my free time I enjoy cycling, camping, and working on DIY home improvement projects.</p>

		<p style="color: MediumBlue; font-size:30px" class="editable"> Beta Gamma Epsilon Engineering Fraternity
		<ul>
		<li style="color:black">I am currently in my second term as President of Northeastern's local engineering fraternity. As president I am responsible for all the operations of the organization, and accomplish this through delegation to my executive board and chairmen and open organization communication lines. I also work to ensure the promotion and welfare of its members at all times</li>
		<li style="color: black"> I also served as the Head Philanthropy Chairman for a year, organizing over 650 man-hours of volunteerwork for various events in the Boston community and raising $1000+ for Habitat for Humanity.
		<li style="color:black"> BGE has been a valuable support network for me as I navigate my college career, and has given me the opportunity to further develop my leadership skills and organizational experience.
		</ul>
	</p>
		<p style="color: MediumBlue; font-size:30px" class="editable"> Camping
			<ul align="left">
			<li style="color:black"> Throughout my journey to attaining the rank of Eagle Scout and in college, I have fostered a love of the outdoors. </li>
			<li style="color:black"> I have spent 2 weeks backpacking in the New Mexico backcountry, climbed Mt. Washington in the winter twice, and gone on countless hikes and summits around New England.</li>
			<li style="color:black"> Exploring the outdoors is something I am extremely passionate about, and I hope to keep heading out to the woods for as long as I am able.
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p style="color: MediumBlue; font-size:30px" class="editable"> Cycling
			<ul align="left">
			<li style="color:black"> In college, I have gained a deep passion for cycling. When I got to Boston I quickly realized that biking is the best form of transportation in the city and had my parents bring up my old Trek 26" mountain bike. I now maintain three bikes in Boston, ride almost every day, and have formed a full mechanic shop in my basement.  </li>
			<li style="color:black"> I have worked part time at a local bike shop for the past year and a half, and the mechanical elegance of biking and depth of the industry has encaptured me.</li>
			<li style="color:black"> This summer I had planned to complete the Ulman Foundation 4k for Cancer, biking from Baltimore to San Francisco in support of young adults with cancer. I raised $4000 for the cause, however ultimately the COVID-19 pandemic forced the ride to become virtual instead. Seeing the positive impact and meeting past participants in the Ulman 4k allowed me to see how far the value of cycling can go, and further cultivated my love for it.</li>
