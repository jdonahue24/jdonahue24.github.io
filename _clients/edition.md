## Background

  style="color:black;"> After not skateboarding in 10 years, I bought a nickel board freshman year. I loved it for getting around campus and being able to bring it into class with me. However, last fall I sprained my ankle playing Ultimate Frisbee, and then again falling off my board a month later, leaving me in crutches. I still have ankle issues now, which makes repeated pushing on a board painful. Seeking another quarantine project, I decided it was time to finally build the electric longboard I had been mulling over for months. </span>
