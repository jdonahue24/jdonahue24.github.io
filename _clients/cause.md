## Summary
<span
  style="color: black;" >In order to be come an Eagle Scout, every candidate must create and lead their own community service project. For my project, I worked with the local Grange in Simsbury, CT to replace the old pavilion behind their building. The project was  over 150 man hours and $1000. </span>
## Before
<span
  style="color: black;" > Built in in the 1930's as a pavilion with a large charcoal pit for lamb roasts, by 2017 half of the roof had disappeared and the other half was on the brink of collapse. Poison ivy and other weeds had overrun the area as well, with trash and other debris adding to the mess. </span>

## Planning
<span
  style="color: black;" > I decided that this would be a cool project to undertake and help out the community. Working closely with my troop's Eagle Scout Advisor, I began the elaborate paperwork and planning required for an Eagle Project. After my proposal was approved, I began the fundraising process while developing a more detailed project plan. </span>
## Fundraising
<span
  style="color: black;"> Using a GoFundMe page to collect donations, I reached out to friends and family to secure donations, as well as secure a significant discount on the cost of my materials from Stanley and Hammond in Avon, CT. </span>
