## Summary
<span
 style="color:black"> In college, I've become a huge fan of DIY home improvement. Especially with the pandemic, I have taken countless trips to Home Depot and completed many projects to maintain my house built in 1889. Most projects have been little, like a new water filter system, repairing doors and locks, and insulating windows. However, I have developed a special love for new flooring, completing over 1200 sq. ft. of new flooring this year. Some of these floors are picture below. Another favorite of mine, also pictured, is repairing the broken woodwork on one wall in the house. While not the most technical or advanced of projects, these home improvement projects have increased my practical skills and given me a sense of accomplishment that I value greatly. </span>
