## Background
<span
  style="color: black;">SpaceX and the Boring Company have run 4 student hyperloop competitions over the last 5 years in Hawthorne, CA. The challenge has been to design and build a fully functional hyperloop pod (minus the passenger compartment) that can travel the fastest in a 1200m vacuum tube and stop itself before the end wall. Paradigm Hyperloop is a multinational team consisting of students from Northeastern University, Memorial University of Newfoundland, and the College of the North Atlantic. </span>
## My Role
<span
  style="color: black;">Northeastern has competed in all four competitions, however I have only had a hand in Comp 4 and preparation for the postponed Competition V. I served as a mechanical designer responsible for the pod chassis. I used Solidworks weldments to design a chassis that would be bale to support every other component of the pod. This meant constant communication with the other subteams and TONS of iterations on the design. After each iteration I would set up a fully defined FEA study to determine if the current design could handle the various forces, especially the braking force, which could cause decelerations of up to 7G's. </span>
