## Summary
<span style="color:black">This past summer I decided to create my online portfolio/personal site myself using a GitHub repository and Jekyll. Using a basic template from CloudCannon called Urban, I crafted this entire website and linked it to a domain I purchased. As with any coding project, I have hit many errors and roadblocks, but I have been able to learn more about HTML and markdown and figure out how to customize a webpage to my specifications. The above photo shows the code for the home page of my website in the Jekyll editor. This project has been extremely rewarding, and a lot of fun to complete versus just using a standard website builder. I feel closely connected to this site now, and have a greater appreciation for every site I visit on the internet now.
